# Project: SNAC Code Conversational Assistant

## Goals

The current goal is to build a conversational system that simulates an assistant responding with SNAC codes.  This involves understanding user input, determining the appropriate SNAC code, and generating a natural language response incorporating the code.

## Project Structure

*   **(To be added):**  A description of the project's directory structure and the purpose of each file or folder.  For example:
    *   `src/`: Contains the source code.
    *   `data/`: Contains any data files used by the system.
    *   `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.

*   **(To be added):**  A diagram showing the relationships between different components of the system.

## Technologies Used

*   **(To be added):** List the programming languages, libraries, and frameworks used in the project.  Examples: Python, Flask, NLTK, etc.

## Getting Started

*   **(To be added):** Instructions on how to set up the development environment and run the project.  This should include any dependencies that need to be installed.

## Future Goals

*   Expand the SNAC code database to include a wider range of scenarios.
*   Improve the natural language processing capabilities of the system to better understand user intent.
*   Implement error handling and input validation to make the system more robust.
*   Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the system.
*   Consider adding features like context awareness and conversation history.
